# Hi There, 

Im Joe, a full stack developer based in Orlando

This GitHub is where I **build, break, and rebuild things on purpose** — experimenting, learning, and improving along the way.

---

I love **designing and building** whatever I can imagine, and when I get an idea, I usually turn it into a real project.

I am also passionate about **cybersecurity and ethical hacking**. I enjoy exploring how systems work, finding vulnerabilities, and learning how to make software more secure.

## Tech Stack

Here’s what I mainly work with:

- **Frontend:** React, Next.js, TypeScript  
- **Backend:** Node.js, Python  
- **Database:** MongoDB

## Favorite Project

One of my favorite projects is **[CFO Agenda Creator](#)** — a tool that helps finance leaders **organize and optimize their meeting agendas**.
