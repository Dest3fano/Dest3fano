# 👋 Hey, I'm Joseph Destefano

**Full-Stack Developer | Always Improving | Learning Cyber to Build Safer Apps**

This GitHub is where I build, break, and rebuild things on purpose.  
It’s separate from my bootcamp work — this is everything I’m building now to level up as a developer and grow into a future security professional.

---

## About Me
I love turning ideas into real, functional applications.

Bootcamp graduate now focused on self-driven projects that show what I can truly build.

Not a cybersecurity pro yet — but actively learning security fundamentals to strengthen the applications I develop.

Developer first, but committed to understanding cyber to build safer, more secure web apps.
