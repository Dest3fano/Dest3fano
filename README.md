# 👋 Hey, I'm Joseph Destefano

**Full-Stack Developer | Lifelong Learner | Aspiring Cybersecurity Engineer**

This GitHub is where I build, break, and rebuild things on purpose.  
It’s separate from my bootcamp work. This is everything I’m building now to level up as a developer and grow into a future security professional.

---

## About Me
I love turning ideas into real, functional applications.

Bootcamp graduate now focused on self-driven projects that show what I can truly build.

I’m not a cybersecurity expert yet, but I’m learning the essentials so the apps I build are secure from the ground up.

Developer first, but committed to understanding cyber to build safer, more secure web apps.
